  Now that the structure is complete, let's make the flow work smoothly.

  Currently when you go to your server main page, for example  <https://randomwittyname.bjelline.repl.co/>,
  you see the Rails Logo and Version.

  It would be easier to use our app if <https://randomwittyname.bjelline.repl.co/> went directly to the topics list.

  In this step we'll make that happen and learn a bit about routes in Rails.

  root 'topics#index'

explanation {

 message <<-MARKDOWN
  * `root 'topics#index'` is a Rails route that says the default
    address for your site is `topics#index`. `topics#index` is the topics
    list page (the topics controller with the index action).
  * Rails routes control how URLs (web addresses) get matched with
    code on the server. Similar to how addresses match with houses and
    apartments.
  * The file `config/routes.rb` is like an address directory listing the
    possible addresses and which code goes with each one
  * `routes.rb` uses some shortcuts so it doesn't always show all the
    possible URLs. To explore the URLs in more detail we can use the
    terminal.

  In the shell window type `rails routes -c topics`. You should get something that
  looks like this:

  ````
$  rails routes -c topics
          Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                Controller#Action
          topics GET    /topics(.:format)          topics#index
                 POST   /topics(.:format)          topics#create
       new_topic GET    /topics/new(.:format)      topics#new
      edit_topic GET    /topics/:id/edit(.:format) topics#edit
           topic GET    /topics/:id(.:format)      topics#show
                 PATCH  /topics/:id(.:format)      topics#update
                 PUT    /topics/:id(.:format)      topics#update
                 DELETE /topics/:id(.:format)      topics#destroy
            root GET    /                          topics#index
  ````
  This shows all the URLs for the topics_controller. The code that starts with colons are variables so :id means the id number of the record. The code in parenthesis is optional.

  You can also get this information on your site in development. Go to your servers URL plus `/rails/info` and you'll see something like this:

  ![Screenshot of browser-based Rails routing info page](img/rails-info-routes.png)

  You'll also see that table in whenever you try to access an invalid route (try your servers URL plus `/sandwich`)
