    **Note:** the above are three separate commands. Type each line into the terminal separately, not as one single command.

    Wait until your console shows that the Puma server has started (just like before).  Then, in the browser, visit <http://localhost:3000/drinks>

    1. Click on "New drink"
    2. Enter Cappuccino for the name
    3. Enter 135 for the temperature.
    4. Click on "Create Drink".

    (The window where you ran `rails server` will display debugging information as you do this.)

    You should see: ![Screenshot of the drink detail page](img/drink-successfully-created-rails7.png)

    In your terminal, Hold Control and hit C (or on Windows, Control-Break, Y) to stop the rails server.
