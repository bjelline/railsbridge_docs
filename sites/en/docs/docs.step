This site is maintained by Brigitte Jellinek. It is a fork of the
official site <a href="https://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/">docs.railsbridge.org</a>.

In this fork I am upgrading all the sites to Rails 7.
If you find something that could be improved, please make a [pull request](https://github.com/bjelline/railsbridge_docs/).

I hope this will be merge into the official repository and this site can go away.


Going through this curriculum on your own? You can get help on <a href="http://discourse.bridgefoundry.org/c/railsbridge-help" target="_blank">our Discourse forum</a>. (Volunteers to answer questions always needed, too!)

Instructions for installing Ruby and **Rails 5** on your computer - work in progress! You need to complete these steps before starting a Rails workshop!
MARKDOWN

h1 'Rails'

site_desc 'intro-to-rails', <<-MARKDOWN
The "classic" RailsBridge curriculum (Suggestotron) upgraded to **Rails 7**. Takes you step-by-step through making a Rails app, one command at a time, using helpers like `rails generate scaffold`, and deploying that app to the Internet.
MARKDOWN

site_desc 'job-board', <<-MARKDOWN
Build a simple job board from scratch with  upgraded to **Rails 7** and a little less of the magic of Rails scaffolding. This curriculum is great for a second or third RailsBridge attendee or for students who want to focus on how the app is wired together. (This curriculum doesn't include deploying to the Internet.)
